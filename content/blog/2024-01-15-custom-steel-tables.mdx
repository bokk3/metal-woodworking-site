# Custom Steel Tables: From Concept to Reality

Creating a custom steel table is more than just metalworking—it's about understanding your space, your needs, and bringing a vision to life. In this post, we'll walk you through our process for a recent commission: a stunning industrial dining table for a modern loft.

## The Client's Vision

Our client wanted a statement piece that would anchor their open-concept dining area. They were drawn to industrial design but needed something refined enough for their contemporary space.

## Design Phase

We started with sketches and 3D renderings, exploring:
- **Material combinations**: Steel frame with reclaimed wood top
- **Dimensions**: 8 feet long to accommodate dinner parties
- **Finish**: Matte black powder coat for durability

## Fabrication

The build process took approximately 40 hours:

1. **Steel cutting and welding** - Creating the base frame
2. **Surface preparation** - Grinding and smoothing all welds
3. **Powder coating** - Professional black matte finish
4. **Wood preparation** - Milling and finishing reclaimed oak
5. **Assembly** - Final fitting and quality control

## The Result

The finished table became the centerpiece of their home, combining raw industrial materials with warm wood tones. The client was thrilled with how it transformed their space.
